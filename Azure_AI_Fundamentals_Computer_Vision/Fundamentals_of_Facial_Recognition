Fundamentals of Facial Recognition

- Learn how to use Azure AI Face service to detect and analyze faces in images.

 Face Detection and Analysis

1. Definition:
    - Utilizes algorithms to find and analyze human faces in images or video content.
2. Applications:
    - Security: Used in security applications and smartphone unlocking.
    - Social Media: Automatically tags known friends in photos.
    - Smart Monitoring: Detects driver attention and fatigue.
    - Advertising: Targets ads based on demographic analysis of faces.
    - Missing Persons: Identifies missing persons in public spaces.
    - Authentication: Used at access points for identity verification.

 Understanding Face Analysis

1. Face Detection:
    - Identifies human face regions in images, returning bounding box coordinates.
2. Face Analysis:
    - Trains models to detect facial features like nose, eyes, eyebrows, and lips.
3. Face Recognition:
    - Uses multiple images of a person to train a model for recognizing known individuals.
    - Enhances efficiency, security, and customer experience.

 Azure AI Face Recognition Service

1. Services:
    - Azure AI Vision: Basic face analysis with bounding boxes.
    - Azure AI Video Indexer: Detects and identifies faces in video.
    - Azure AI Face: Advanced detection, recognition, and analysis with pre-built algorithms.
2. Attributes:
    - Accessories: Detects items like hats, glasses, masks with confidence scores.
    - Blur: Measures face blur indicating image focus.
    - Exposure: Determines if the face is under or overexposed.
    - Glasses: Detects if the person is wearing glasses.
    - Head Pose: Analyzes face direction in 3D space.
    - Mask: Detects if a mask is worn.
    - Noise: Identifies visual noise affecting clarity.
    - Occlusion: Detects objects blocking the face.

 Responsible AI Usage

1. Responsible AI Standards:
    - Microsoft enforces a Limited Access policy for Azure AI Face and Azure AI Vision.
2. Basic Features:
    - Detects face positions, glasses, obstructions, blur, noise, exposure, and head pose.
3. Advanced Features (Limited Access):
    - Compares faces for similarity.
    - Identifies named individuals in images.

 Azure Face Recognition Resources

1. Resource Types:
    - Face Recognition: Dedicated to face recognition only.
    - Azure AI Services: Includes multiple AI services for broader usage and simplified management.

 Tips for Improved Detection Accuracy

1. Image Format: Supports JPEG, PNG, GIF, and BMP.
2. File Size: Should be 6 MB or smaller.
3. Face Size Range: 36 x 36 to 4096 x 4096 pixels.
4. Common Issues: Detection may be impaired by extreme face angles, lighting, and occlusions.

Notes : 

- The locations of detected faces are indicated by coordinates for a rectangular bounding box
- Best results are obtained when the faces are full-frontal or as near as possible to full-frontal (impairment to detection)
- The Face resource has face detections capabilities, and can be used in Vision Studio to understand its capabilities.
