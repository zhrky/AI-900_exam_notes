Fundamentals of optical character recognition

Optical character recognition (OCR) enables artificial intelligence (AI) systems to read text in images, enabling applications to extract information from photographs, scanned documents, and other sources of digitized text.

- Learn how to read text in images with Azure AI Vision.

 Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Overview

1. Definition:
    - OCR enables machines to read text in images, converting it to machine-readable text.
2. Uses of OCR:
    - Automates text processing to improve speed and efficiency.
    - Recognizes printed and handwritten text in images for scenarios like:
        - Note taking
        - Digitizing medical records
        - Scanning historical documents
        - Processing bank checks
3. OCR and AI:
    - Combines computer vision (to "read" text) and natural language processing (to interpret text).
    - Uses machine learning models to recognize shapes as letters, numerals, punctuation, etc.
    - Initially used by postal services for automatic mail sorting.
4. Azure AI Vision's OCR Capabilities:
    - Extracts machine-readable text from images, PDFs, and TIFF files.
    - Read API (Read OCR engine) uses advanced recognition models.
    - Optimized for images with significant text or visual noise.
5. Read API Structure:
    - Pages: Each page of text with size and orientation info.
    - Lines: Lines of text on a page.
    - Words: Words in a line of text with bounding box coordinates and text.
6. Setting Up Azure AI Vision:
    - Create a resource in Azure subscription:
        - Azure AI Vision: Specific to vision services.
        - Azure AI Services: General resource including multiple AI services.
7. Using Azure AI Vision's Read API:
    - Methods:
        - Vision Studio
        - REST API
        - SDKs: Python, C#, JavaScript
8. Azure AI Vision Studio:
    - Provides a GUI for accessing Azure AI Vision APIs without coding.
    - Requires an Azure AI services resource.
    - Features:
        - Optical Character Recognition
        - Extract text from images
    - Returns results with bounding box locations and detected text in JSON format.
    - Ideal for examples; SDK or REST API needed for custom OCR applications.

Notes : 

- An Azure AI services resource supports both Azure AI Vision for text extraction, and Azure AI Language for text analytics.
- The Read API takes an image and extracts the words, organizing the results by page and line.
