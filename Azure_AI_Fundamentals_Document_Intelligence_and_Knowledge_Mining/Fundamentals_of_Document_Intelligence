Fundamentals of Azure AI Document Intelligence

 Document Intelligence: Key Points

Document Intelligence Overview:

- Extends Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
- Automates extracting, understanding, and recording data from text.
- Useful for processing receipts, project costs, and accounting purposes.

Example Application:

- Organization processes receipts with document intelligence.
- Scanned image text converted to digital via OCR.
- Specific data like vendor name, address, total value, and tax value extracted.

Azure AI Document Intelligence:

- Supports analysis of documents and forms with pre-built and custom models.

Document Intelligence Features:

Document Analysis:

- Based on machine learning models trained to recognize data in text.
- Extracts text, layout, and key-value pairs.
- Identifies text positions on a page using bounding box coordinates.

Challenges and Solutions:

- Forms and documents come in various formats.
- Different models needed for different document types (e.g., tax forms vs. ID documents).
- Pre-built models for common formats and custom models for unique formats.

Benefits:

- Speeds up text reading and data recording processes.
- Enhances customer experiences.
- Improves decision-making.

Azure Receipt Analysis:

Model Types:

1. Pre-Built Models:
    - Trained to recognize specific fields in common document types like invoices, business cards, IDs.
    - Extracts details like customer/vendor info, sales/transaction details, ID verification details, health insurance details, business contact info, contract details, tax details.
2. Custom Models:
    - Trainable to identify specific fields not covered by pre-built models.

Receipt Model Example:

- Processes receipts by matching field names with values.
- Identifies data tables, specific fields like dates, phone numbers, addresses, totals.
- Recognizes various receipt types (thermal, hotel, gas, credit card, parking receipts).

Recognized Fields * :

- Vendor name, address, phone number.
- Purchase date and time.
- Item names, quantities, prices.
- Total, subtotal, tax values.
- Each field has a confidence level indicating accuracy.

Image Requirements:

- Formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, PDF, TIFF.
- Size: <500 MB (paid), <4 MB (free).
- Resolution: 50x50 to 10000x10000 pixels.
- PDF: Max 17x17 inches.
- One receipt per document.

Testing and Using Document Analysis:

- Use Document Intelligence Studio for pre-built and custom models.
- Create Document Intelligence or Azure AI services resource in Azure subscription.
- Free tier available with some limitations (e.g., only first two pages of PDF/TIFF processed).

Using the Resource:

- Access the resource using the provided keys and endpoint.
- Integrate the resource with client applications for document analysis.

Document Intelligence Studio:

- A user interface for testing pre-built models and creating custom models.
- Enables you to train and evaluate models for specific document types and extraction needs.

Advantages of Document Intelligence:

- Accuracy: High accuracy in recognizing and extracting relevant data from documents.
- Efficiency: Reduces manual data entry, minimizing errors and speeding up processes.
- Scalability: Can handle large volumes of documents, making it suitable for businesses with extensive documentation needs.
- Customization: Allows for the creation of custom models to cater to unique document formats and extraction requirements.
- Integration: Easy to integrate with existing workflows and systems using Azure's API.

Practical Applications:

- Invoice Processing: Automates extraction of invoice details for faster accounts payable processing.
- Receipt Management: Streamlines expense reporting by extracting details from receipts.
- ID Verification: Automates verification processes by extracting data from identification documents.
- Contract Management: Extracts and organizes key contract details for legal and compliance purposes.

Conclusion:
Azure AI Document Intelligence offers robust tools for automating the extraction, understanding, and processing of data from a wide range of documents. By leveraging pre-built models and the ability to create custom models, businesses can enhance their operational efficiency, reduce errors, and make informed decisions based on accurately extracted data.
