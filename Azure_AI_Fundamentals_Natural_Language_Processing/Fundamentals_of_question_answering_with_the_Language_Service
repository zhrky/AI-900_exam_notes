Fundamentals of question answering with the Language Service


 Conversational AI with Azure AI Language: Key Points

Communication Challenges:

- Instant, personalized responses are expected without reading detailed documents.
- Support personnel are often overloaded with multiple channel requests.

Conversational AI:

- Enables communication between an AI agent (bot) and a human.
- Interaction channels include web chat, email, social media, etc.

Azure AI Language for Question Answering:

- Supports building conversational AI solutions with automatic responses.
- Useful for bot applications that answer customer queries instantly and accurately.
- Bots can be deployed on various platforms (e.g., websites, social media).

Benefits:

- Provides quick answers, reduces wait times.
- Allows users to interact at their convenience, regardless of office hours.

Bot Example:

- Uses natural language to provide response options.
- Escalates to a human only if the query is complex.

Combining Azure Services:

- Azure AI Language: Creates a Q&A knowledge base using the question-answering feature.
- Azure AI Bot Service: Framework for developing, publishing, and managing bots.

Creating a Q&A Knowledge Base:

1. Azure AI Language Studio:
    - Use to create, train, publish, and manage Q&A projects.
    - Can use REST API or SDK for project creation and management.
2. Defining Questions and Answers:
    - Source from existing FAQ documents or web pages.
    - Manually enter and edit questions and answers.
    - Combine techniques for comprehensive projects.
    - Assign alternative phrases to questions for better understanding.

Testing the Project:

- Save the Q&A pairs, analyze, and match appropriate answers to questions.
- Use the built-in testing interface in Language Studio to validate responses.

Building a Bot with Azure AI Bot Service:

1. Create and deploy a bot integrated with the knowledge base.
2. Use the Microsoft Bot Framework SDK for custom bot development.
3. Alternatively, use automatic bot creation for easier deployment.

Connecting Channels:

- Enable interaction through multiple channels (web chat, email, Microsoft Teams, etc.).
- Users can send questions and receive appropriate responses from the knowledge base via any connected channel.

Notes : 

- You can import question and answer pairs from an existing FAQ document into a question answering knowledge base.
- Question Answering is part of the Azure AI Language service and enables you to create a knowledge base of question and answer pairs

SUMMARY : 

Azure AI Language's custom question answering feature enables you to define and publish a knowledge base of questions and answers with support for natural language querying. When combined with Azure AI Bot Service, you can use a knowledge base to deliver a bot that responds intelligently to user questions over multiple communication channels.

The ability to create conversational AI solutions with these services makes it possible for AI agents to reduce the support workload for human personnel; enabling organizations to provide user support at global scale.
